-  Encapsulation is wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
-  In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and 
   can be accessed only through any member function of own class
-  Encapsulation helps us in binding the member functions and data of a class.
-  it also helps us make code flexible, which is easy to change and maintain.


Example:-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Encapsulation {

private:
    int x;

public:
    void set(int a) { 
           x = a;
           }
    int get() {
          return x; 
          }
};
 
int main()
{
    Encapsulation obj;
    obj.set(5);
    cout << obj.get();
    return 0;
}


First, make all the data members private.
Then getter and setter functions should be performed for each data member.
